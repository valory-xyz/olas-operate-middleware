Fixtures for pytest

The conftest.py file serves as a means of providing fixtures for an entire
directory. Fixtures defined in a conftest.py can be used by any test in that
package without needing to import them (pytest will automatically discover them).

See https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/reference/fixtures.html
